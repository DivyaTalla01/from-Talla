One of my favorite books is the "Mahabharatham," an epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes. It's a timeless piece of literature with profound teachings and stories.

As for my favorite song, I enjoy listening to melodious tunes that evoke emotions and memories. There's something special about the way melodies can connect with the soul and create a lasting impact.

Here's an image of myself:
